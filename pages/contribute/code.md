title: Contribute Code to a Project
---

If you have programming skills and want to have a direct impact on the development of our open-source game projects, we invite you to contribute code. By addressing issues or adding new features, you can help shape the games and enhance the player experience.

## Getting Started

To get started, we encourage you to visit the project's website, where you can find valuable information about the game, its development roadmap, and any specific areas that need attention. Additionally, exploring the project's GitHub page is essential. There, you can review the existing issues and feature requests, which provide valuable insights into the areas that the project team would appreciate help with.

Once you've identified an issue or feature that aligns with your skills and interests, fork the repository to create your own working copy. This allows you to make the necessary modifications without directly affecting the main codebase. Next, dive into the code and start working on the identified task.

## Making Progress and Submitting Changes

As you make progress, it's crucial to maintain open communication with the project team. Consider joining their community forums or chat channels, where you can ask questions, seek guidance, and collaborate with other contributors. By engaging in discussions, you'll ensure that your efforts align with the project's vision and coding conventions.

Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request via GitHub. This signals to the project team that you have completed the task and are ready for their review. The team will carefully evaluate your code, provide feedback, and guide you through any necessary revisions. If your code meets the project's standards and aligns with its goals, it will be merged into the main codebase, making your contributions an integral part of the game's development.

## Thank You

By actively checking out the project's website and GitHub page for areas that need attention, you can make a valuable contribution to our open-source game projects. Your coding skills and dedication are key to driving the growth and improvement of these games, and we truly appreciate your commitment to the community.
