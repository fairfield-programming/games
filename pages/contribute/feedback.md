Quality assurance is vital for the success of open-source game projects, and your active participation in playtesting, providing feedback, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements can make a significant impact on the overall quality and polish of the games.

## Playtesting

We encourage you to playtest the games developed by FPA Games and share your valuable insights. Take the time to thoroughly explore the game mechanics, user interface, level design, and overall gameplay experience. Pay attention to details such as balance, difficulty, responsiveness, and immersion. By actively engaging with the games, you can provide constructive feedback that helps the developers refine and enhance the player experience.

If you encounter any bugs, glitches, or technical issues during your playtesting, we appreciate your assistance in reporting them. Visit the project websites or forums associated with the games to find information on how to submit bug reports. Provide clear and detailed descriptions of the issue, including steps to reproduce it and any relevant error messages. Your bug reports are invaluable in helping the development team identify and resolve issues, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience for all players.

## Suggestions

In addition to bug reports, we welcome your suggestions for improvements. If you have ideas on how to enhance gameplay mechanics, introduce new features, or refine existing systems, we encourage you to share them. Your fresh perspective and creative ideas can inspire developers to innovate and iterate on the games, further improving their quality and appeal.

By actively participating in the testing process, providing feedback, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements, you contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of the games. Your dedication and attention to detail are essential in ensuring that open-source games achieve the highest levels of quality and playability.
