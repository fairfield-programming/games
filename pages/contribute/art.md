title: Create 3D Models, Content, and Mods
---

Artists and designers possess a unique ability to make significant contributions to open-source game projects. By creating 3D models, textures, audio assets, or other game content, you have the opportunity to enhance the visual and immersive aspects of the games. Open-source games often thrive on community-generated content and mods that expand the gameplay experience, and your creative skills can play a vital role in shaping these projects.

## Game Assets

If you have skills in game asset creation, we invite you to consider contributing your work to existing open-source games or collaborating with developers to create new experiences. Your 3D models, textures, and audio assets can breathe life into game worlds, adding depth, realism, and aesthetic appeal. Your creative vision can help shape characters, environments, objects, or even entire game levels.

To get started, we recommend getting in touch with the relevant project teams. Visit the project's website or their community forums to find information on how to reach out to them. Share your ideas, showcase your portfolio or samples of your work, and express your interest in contributing. Collaborating with the project team allows you to align your contributions with the game's vision, receive feedback, and ensure seamless integration of your assets into the game.

## Modding

Moreover, consider exploring the world of modding, which allows you to create custom content and modifications that enhance or extend the gameplay experience. Mods can introduce new levels, characters, gameplay mechanics, or even entirely new game modes. By creating mods, you contribute to the ever-evolving nature of open-source games and offer players diverse and captivating experiences.
