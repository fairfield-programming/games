## What do donations help with?

At FPA Games, we deeply appreciate the invaluable support provided by donations, as they play a crucial role in sustaining open-source game development. Your financial contributions can make a significant impact by helping us cover essential expenses such as hosting costs, server maintenance, and infrastructure upgrades. These contributions enable us to provide stable and accessible platforms for players to enjoy the games.

Moreover, donations directly support the dedicated developers who invest their time and expertise in creating and maintaining the open-source games. Your generosity can help provide them with resources, tools, and development environments necessary for enhancing and expanding the gaming experiences. By funding their work, you contribute to their ability to focus on refining gameplay mechanics, adding new features, and addressing community feedback.

## How do I donate?

If you're interested in donating, we encourage you to visit the individual project websites associated with the games you're passionate about. Each project's website provides detailed information on how to contribute financially, allowing you to directly support the specific games you love. Whether it's a one-time donation or a recurring contribution, your generosity helps ensure the continued development and improvement of these open-source games. Every donation, regardless of the amount, is deeply appreciated and makes a meaningful difference in our ability to provide high-quality open-source games to the community.
