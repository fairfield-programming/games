title: Share the Games with Your Friends
---

Word-of-mouth is a powerful tool for promoting open-source games and expanding their reach. We encourage you to share the games developed by FPA Games with your friends, gaming communities, and social media networks. By spreading the word, you contribute to the growth and success of our projects while supporting the hard work of our dedicated developers.

## Spread the Word Online

One effective way to share the games is by writing reviews or sharing your personal experiences. Share your thoughts and impressions about the games on gaming forums, review platforms, or your own blog. Explain what you enjoyed, highlight unique features, and provide recommendations to pique the interest of potential players. Honest and well-crafted reviews can go a long way in generating curiosity and attracting new players.

Additionally, consider creating and sharing gameplay videos. Record your playthroughs, tutorials, or highlights and upload them to platforms like YouTube or Twitch. Be sure to include the game's name, relevant tags, and a link to the project's website or official channels in the video description. Gameplay videos are a visual and engaging way to showcase the games, providing potential players with a glimpse into the exciting experiences they can expect.

## Engage with the Community

Engaging in discussions about the games is another impactful way to spread the word. Participate in relevant gaming communities, social media groups, and forums where gamers gather. Share your enthusiasm for the games, answer questions from curious players, and provide insights based on your own experiences. By actively participating in these discussions, you contribute to the buzz around the games and help attract more players to join the community.

Your active promotion and advocacy can make a significant difference in the success and longevity of our open-source game projects. We appreciate your efforts in sharing the games and supporting our passionate developers.
