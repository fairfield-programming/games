title: Join a Team as an Admin or Moderator
---

At FPA Games, we recognize that each of our game developers may have its own unique process for bringing new members into their teams. If you have organizational skills, effective communication abilities, or experience in community management, we encourage you to explore opportunities to join these teams and contribute to their success.

## Joining a Developer

Each developer may have specific guidelines and requirements for becoming an admin or moderator within their project. We recommend visiting the respective project's website or GitHub repository to find information on their specific process for joining the team. Look for dedicated sections on how to get involved, contribute, or join the development efforts. There, you may find details on the skills they are seeking, the application process, or contact information to express your interest.

Remember, each developer may have their own distinct process for joining their team. Taking the time to understand their specific requirements and guidelines will help you navigate the process more effectively. Whether you choose to join individual projects or express interest in joining FPA Games, your contributions as an admin or moderator can have a significant impact on project management, community engagement, and the overall success of open-source game development.

## Joining FPA Games

In addition to individual projects, you also have the opportunity to join FPA Games directly. As an open-source game publisher, FPA Games is committed to fostering a collaborative environment and supporting open-source game development as a whole. If you are interested in joining FPA Games, we invite you to reach out to us directly through our website. Tell us about your relevant experience, including your organizational skills, communication abilities, and any prior involvement in community management or project coordination. We would love to learn more about your passion for open-source game development and discuss potential opportunities within our organization.
