Donations play a crucial role in sustaining open-source game development. Your financial contributions can help cover hosting costs, support developers, and fund new features and enhancements.

## [Contribute Code to a Project](/contribute/code)

If you have programming skills and want to make a direct impact, consider contributing code to one of our open-source game projects. Browse our repositories on GitHub to find projects that align with your interests and skills. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Our team will review your code and, if it meets the project's guidelines, merge it into the main codebase.

## [Join a Team as an Admin or Moderator](/contribute/team)

FPA Games and each of its developers relies on dedicated admins and moderators to ensure smooth project management and community engagement. If you have organizational skills, communication abilities, or experience in community management, consider joining one of our teams.

Artists and designers can make significant contributions by creating 3D models, textures, audio assets, or other game content.

## [Provide Feedback and Bug Reports](/contribute/feedback)

Quality assurance is vital for open-source game projects. Playtest the games, provide feedback on gameplay mechanics, report bugs, and suggest improvements. By actively participating in the testing process, you contribute to the overall quality and polish of the games.
